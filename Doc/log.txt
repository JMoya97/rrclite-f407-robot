2. Removed LVGL and the LCD panel.
3. Removed the SBUS module.
4. Ported the encoder motors, but encoder 3 has pins PD12 and PD13 swapped on the schematic.
5. The two button interfaces share the same design and remain untested.
6. The PWM servo interface matches the original design and remains untested.
7. A new driver is needed for the second I2C1 interface.
8. The three LED pins cannot be used until the UART3 interface is migrated to UART1.
9. The RGB LED library needs to be ported.
10. The RRC I2C bus maps to RRCLite I2C2, which connects to the IMU (QMI8658) and must be reimplemented.
11. The bus-servo interface must be replaced.
12. The host-side motor type switch interface still needs to be implemented.

1. Ported the QMI8658 successfully.
2. Ported the OLED screen on I2C1 and verified battery monitoring.
3. Verified both button interfaces.
4. The bus-servo interface still needs to be replaced.
5. The RGB LEDs run from SPI1; they worked once but then failed for unknown reasons (temporarily deferred).
6. The three LED pins still depend on migrating the UART3 interface to UART1.
7. The host-side motor type switch and battery voltage alarm interfaces still need to be implemented.

1. Ported the bus-servo interface successfully.
2. Ported the UART1 host communication interface successfully.
3. Finished porting the three LEDs.
4. Host motor type switch interface:
        Under motor function code 3, sub-function 5 carries a uint16_t that encodes the type:
                MOTOR_TYPE_JGB520 = 0
                MOTOR_TYPE_JGB37 = 1
                MOTOR_TYPE_JGA27 = 2
                MOTOR_TYPE_JGB528 = 3
5. Battery voltage alarm configuration interface:
        Under system settings function code 0, sub-function 1 provides a uint16_t low-voltage threshold.
6. RGB LED functionality and host interface.

1. In progress: implementing the RGB LED driver (work delayed by MechDog tasks).

2024/06/29
1. RGB LED driver is now working.
        Function code 11 uses the following payload structure:
        // RGB LED structure
        typedef struct {
                uint8_t id;
                uint8_t data[];
        } RGBCtlTypeDef;
        When id == 0, the data array has six elements: g1, r1, b1, g2, r2, b2.
        When id is 1 or 2, the data array has three elements: g, r, b.
